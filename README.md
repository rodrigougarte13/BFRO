# Big Foot Sightings Dataset Visuals

This project was conducted collaboratively with a team of five, focusing on analyzing the Bigfoot sightings dataset. We utilized advanced libraries such as SpaCy for natural language processing and geoparser for geographical analysis to conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis. The dataset was cleaned and processed to uncover insights and patterns related to Bigfoot sightings.

One of the project's highlights was the integration of D3.js for data visualization, which allowed us to create interactive visualizations showcasing intriguing patterns and findings from the dataset. These visualizations provided a visually compelling way to present our discoveries and engage with the data.
